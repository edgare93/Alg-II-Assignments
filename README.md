# Alg-II-Assignments
A compilation of the code from my Algorithms Part II class. This repository isn't intended to be run as-is, simply to make the code viewable. Most of the assignments are missing input files and some may be missing accompanying files which were provided as part of the assignments.

Baseball elimination uses a provided network flow implementation to calculate whether a given baseball team is mathematically eliminated from a series.
